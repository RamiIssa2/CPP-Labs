# Lab Assignment #3 for the C++ Programming Course

## Using the Standard Template Library (STL): Containers and Algorithms

The assignment consists of a sequence of interconnected tasks.  
**Main Objective:** For each task, solve the formulated problem as efficiently as possible. For most tasks, except possibly the first, using loops will not be considered a correct solution.

## Tasks:

1. **Create a vector `v1`** with a size between 500 and 1000 elements. The number of elements is unknown until the program runs. The elements of the vector are instances of the class from Lab Work â„–2, with arbitrary (random) values. If necessary, this class should be updated to handle the tasks of this lab work.

2. **Create a vector `v2`**, placing the last 200 elements of `v1` into it. Consider a generalized solution for arbitrary values of `b` and `e`, which specify the positions of the first and last copied elements.

3. **Form a list `list1`**, placing the first `n` (from 20 to 50) largest elements of `v1` into it. The specified elements should be sorted before being added to the list.

4. **Form a list `list2`**, placing the last `n` (from 20 to 50) smallest elements of `v2` into it. The order of the elements is not important.

5. **Remove the moved elements** from vectors `v1` and `v2`. Adjust the sizes of the vectors after the removal of elements.

6. **For list `list1`**, find the element with the median value. Rearrange the list's elements so that all elements greater than the median are placed at the beginning.

7. **Remove all odd elements** from `list2` (or use another criterion that uniquely divides the instances of your class into two non-overlapping sets).

8. **Create a vector `v3`** from the elements that are present in both `v1` and `v2`.

9. **For lists `list1` and `list2`**, from the list with the larger number of elements, remove the first `n` elements so that both lists have the same size. Form a new list `list3`, which will store pairs:
   `<first element of list1, first element of list2>`, `<second element of list1, second element of list2>`, and so on.

10. **Solve the previous task for vectors `v1` and `v2`** without first resizing the vectors to the same size. There should be no pairs with empty values.

## Deliverables:

Prepare a report and upload it according to the established rules.

**Note on Efficiency**: Efficiency here refers to solutions that use minimal code and avoid unnecessary operations.
